added the pictures instead of those blocks
fixed the window moving bug which every time we try to move the pac man upwards or downwards the window also used to move
added more ghosts to increase the difficulty
when made dizzy their pictures or faces change and a different emotioned png is added
when dizzy i made them to freeze at their places for 3 seconds to balance out the difficulty
if the ghosts are inside the ghost-lair that is in the beginning of the game then just try to move them out of the ghost lair and never let them in unless pac man eats the ghost this increases difficulty 
added the score board using localstorage
changed the dom a bit
when pressed space user it is redirected to the game
removed the scrolling ability since space bar is assigned for that task
added a separate callback function for the keydown event listener since there are multiple functions apart from moving pacman exists
added a pause menu
